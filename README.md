Steps to follow -

1. Clone the repository.
2. npm install
3. npm install -g json-server
4. Then start the server by this command (npm run dev)
5. Then open new terminal and enter this command to start json server ( json-server --watch db.json --port 3000 ) without this profile won't work.

After server starts hold 3 to 4 second on Home page to get load because I have used three.js library. The Earth is responsive to scroll zoom in and out. It also rotate hold click on the earth and rotate in any direction you want.
